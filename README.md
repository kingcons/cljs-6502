# cljs-6502

A work-in-progress Clojurescript port of [cl-6502](https://github.com/redline6561/cl-6502).

## Quickstart

Getting a REPL for a simple project going with Clojurescript is more
involved than for Clojure. Try the following:

```
git clone git://github.com/redline6561/cljs-6502/;
cd cljs-6502 && lein repl
```
Once the repl is running, connect to it with your client of choice and
run `(cemerick.piggieback/cljs-repl)`.
