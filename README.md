# cljs-6502

A Clojurescript port of [cl-6502](https://github.com/redline6561/cl-6502).

## Quickstart

Getting a REPL for a simple project going with Clojurescript is more
involved than for Clojure. Try the following:

```
git clone git://github.com/redline6561/cljs-6502/;
cd cljs-6502;
lein cljsbuild once && lein ring server 8080
```

Then visit `localhost:8080/test.html` in your browser and in a new
terminal run `lein trampoline cljsbuild repl-listen`.
